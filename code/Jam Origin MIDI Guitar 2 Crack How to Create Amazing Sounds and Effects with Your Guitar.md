Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 is a revolutionary software that converts your guitar's analog signal to MIDI, allowing you to use your guitar as a MIDI controller. You can play your favorite synths or samplers with your guitar, or add any virtual instrument or effect to your guitar rig. Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 is the most ambitious guitar processor ever made, with state-of-the-art guitar tracking and low-latency polyphonic performance.
 
However, Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 is not a cheap software. It costs $99 for a single license, and you need to activate it online with a serial number. If you don't want to pay for it, you might be tempted to look for a crack version online. But be warned: cracking software is illegal, unethical, and risky. You might end up with a virus, malware, or spyware on your computer, or face legal consequences for violating the software's terms of service.

Fortunately, there is a way to use Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 for free, legally and safely. Jam Origin offers a free trial version of the software that you can download from their website[^1^]. The trial version has all the features of the full version, except that it will stop working after 10 minutes of use. You can restart it as many times as you want, but you will lose your settings and patches every time.
 
If you want to use Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 for longer than 10 minutes without interruption, you can use a workaround that involves recording your guitar signal in a DAW (digital audio workstation) and then routing it to Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 as an audio input. This way, you can bypass the trial limitation and use the software as long as you want. Here are the steps to do this:
 
1. Download and install Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 trial version from their website[^1^].
2. Download and install a DAW of your choice, such as Reaper[^2^], Audacity[^3^], or FL Studio[^4^].
3. Connect your guitar to your computer via an audio interface or a microphone.
4. Open your DAW and create a new project.
5. Create two tracks: one for recording your guitar signal (MGaudio), and one for hosting Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 as a plugin (MGmidi).
6. On the MGaudio track, select your guitar input as the source and arm it for recording.
7. On the MGmidi track, insert Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 as a plugin and select "Audio Input" as the input mode.
8. On both tracks, enable monitoring so you can hear what you are playing.
9. Start recording on the MGaudio track and play your guitar. You should hear the sound of Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 on the MGmidi track.
10. Stop recording when you are done. You can save your project and export your MIDI data from the MGmidi track.

This workaround will allow you to use Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 for free without any time limit. However, it has some drawbacks. You will not be able to change the settings or patches of Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2 while playing, unless you stop recording and restart the plugin. You will also not be able to use other plugins or effects on the MGmidi track, unless you route them before Jam Origin MIDI Guitar 2. And of course, you will not be able to update or get support from Jam Origin if you encounter any problems with the software.
