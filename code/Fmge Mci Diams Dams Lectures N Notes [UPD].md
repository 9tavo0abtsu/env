You should revise the entire syllabus at least 2-3 times before the exam, with regular intervals. You can use the DIAMS DAMS lectures and notes for revision, as they cover all the important points and concepts in a concise manner.

- Attempt Maximum Number of MCQs: The FMGE MCI exam consists of 300 multiple choice questions, which test your knowledge, application, and analytical skills. To ace this exam, you should attempt as many MCQs as possible from various sources, such as DIAMS DAMS mock tests, previous year papers, online platforms, etc. This will help you improve your speed, accuracy, and confidence. You should also analyze your performance after each test and learn from your mistakes.
- Attempt Mock Tests: Mock tests are simulated exams that mimic the actual exam pattern and difficulty level. They are very useful for assessing your preparation level and identifying your strengths and weaknesses. You should attempt at least one mock test per week from one month prior to the exam. You can use the DIAMS DAMS mock tests or any other reliable source for this purpose. You should also review your answers and solutions after each mock test and work on your weak areas.

- Stay Motivated and Positive: Last but not least, you should stay motivated and positive throughout your preparation journey. You should not let any negative thoughts or emotions affect your focus and determination. You should believe in yourself and your abilities, and trust your preparation.
