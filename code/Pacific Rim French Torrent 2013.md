# Pacific Rim: A Sci-Fi Action Thriller
 
Pacific Rim is a 2013 movie directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, and Charlie Day. It is set in a near future where giant alien monsters called Kaiju emerge from an interdimensional portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and wage war on humanity. To combat them, humans create massive robots called Jaegers that are piloted by two or more people who share a neural link. The movie follows a former Jaeger pilot who is recruited to join a last-ditch effort to stop the Kaiju invasion.

Some of the notable critics who gave positive reviews include Roger Ebert, who awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, "Pacific Rim knows what sort of film it wishes to be; it is that film, and much more. In its clanking, crashing way, it's real science fiction, a play of ideas. It's earnest in its belief that all thinking beings are part of a hive mind, or could be."[^1^] Matt Zoller Seitz of rogerebert.com also praised the film for its emotional depth and homage to classic sci-fi and monster movies[^1^]. IGN's Jim Vejvoda gave the film a score of 8 out of 10 and called it "a grand, light and often entertaining popcorn chomper" that delivers on its promise of giant robots versus giant monsters[^3^].
 
On the other hand, some of the critics who gave negative reviews include Anthony Quinn of The Independent, who gave the film one star out of five and dismissed it as "a toy franchise with a deafeningly loud movie attached - Transformers with an A-level."[^2^] Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and described it as "a series of Godzilla monsters battle an ever dwindling number of Transformers, layered over the plot from Independence Day, only dumber."[^2^] Keith Garlington of Keith & the Movies gave the film a mixed review and wrote, "Made to be seen on a stories-high screen with a jumbo tub of popcorn on your lap, Pacific Rim is serviceable summer entertainment, recommended based on the sheer scale of del Toro's onscreen spectacle."[^4^]
