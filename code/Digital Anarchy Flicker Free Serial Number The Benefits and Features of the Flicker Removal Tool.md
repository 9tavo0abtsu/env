It analyzes the color information in your footage and eliminates flicker with ease. You can use presets for different types of flicker or tweak a few parameters to get the best results.

## Step 2: Apply Digital Anarchy Flicker Free to Your Footage
 
The next step is to apply Digital Anarchy Flicker Free to your footage in your video editing application. Depending on your application, you can find the plugin in different places. For example, in After Effects, you can find it under Effects > Digital Anarchy > Flicker Free. In Premiere Pro, you can find it under Video Effects > Digital Anarchy > Flicker Free.
 
Once you apply the plugin to your footage, you will see a window with several parameters and options. The most important ones are:
 
- **Preset**: This is where you can choose a preset for different types of flicker. The presets are based on common scenarios and settings that work well for most cases. You can choose from Time Lapse, Slow Motion / High Frame Rate (HFR), Rolling Bands (LED Lights), Drone / Aerial Footage, Archival Footage, Detect Motion (Slow), Detect Motion (Fast), and Custom.
- **Sensitivity**: This is where you can adjust how sensitive the plugin is to detecting flicker. A higher value means more flicker will be removed, but it may also affect the quality of your footage. A lower value means less flicker will be removed, but it may also preserve more details in your footage. The default value is 10.
- **Time Radius**: This is where you can adjust how many frames the plugin analyzes before and after the current frame to remove flicker. A higher value means more frames will be analyzed, but it may also slow down the rendering time. A lower value means fewer frames will be analyzed, but it may also reduce the effectiveness of removing flicker. The default value is 5.
- **Motion Detection**: This is where you can enable or disable the optical flow algorithms that detect and compensate for motion in your footage. This option is only available for the Detect Motion presets and the Custom preset. Enabling this option will improve the results for shots with a moving camera or a lot of movement in the video, 8cf37b1e13
