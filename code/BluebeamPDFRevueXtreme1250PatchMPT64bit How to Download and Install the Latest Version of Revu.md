3. Run the installer file and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter your serial number and product key that you received when you purchased Revu eXtreme. If you don't have them, you can request a trial version or contact Bluebeam support.
4. After the installation is complete, you will need to apply the Patch MPT 64-bit to activate Revu eXtreme and unlock all its features. The Patch MPT 64-bit is a crack tool that modifies the original program files and bypasses the license verification process.

7. Navigate to the folder where the patch package is installed. It should be something like "C:\Users\YourName\node\_modules\bluebeampdfrevuextreme1250patchmpt64bit\_wlhwt". There you will find a file named "Bluebeam.PDF.Revu.eXtreme.12.5.0-MPT.exe". This is the patch tool that you need to run.
