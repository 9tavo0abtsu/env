## What is Civil 3D 2019?
 
Civil 3D 2019 is a civil infrastructure design and documentation software solution that works with a model-based environment for better design decisions and project quality. It harnesses the power of BIM (Building Information Modeling) for greater design coordination and project collaboration. It also streamlines construction documentation with a design-driven approach to plans production.
 
Civil 3D 2019 supports workflows for various civil engineering projects, including roads and highways, rail, bridges and tunnels, site development, and storm and sanitary networks. It includes purpose-built tools for critical civil engineering disciplines, such as corridor modeling, grading, earthwork calculations, pipe networks, alignment and profile design, cross sections, plan production, and more.
 
## How to Use Civil 3D 2019 for Road and Highway Design
 
One of the most common applications of Civil 3D 2019 is road and highway design. Civil 3D 2019 allows you to create dynamic and data-rich models of roads and highways that can be easily modified and updated throughout the design process. You can also generate accurate plans, profiles, cross sections, quantities, and reports based on your model.
 
Some of the steps involved in road and highway design using Civil 3D 2019 are:
 
- Create alignments and profiles to define the horizontal and vertical geometry of your road or highway.
- Create assemblies and subassemblies to define the cross-sectional components of your road or highway.
- Create corridors to generate a 3D model of your road or highway based on the alignments, profiles, assemblies, and subassemblies.
- Create surfaces to represent the existing and proposed terrain conditions along your road or highway.
- Analyze your corridor model for design criteria violations, sight distance issues, drainage problems, etc.
- Create feature lines, grading objects, and pipe networks to add details to your road or highway design.
- Create cross sections to show the cut and fill volumes along your road or highway.
- Create plan sheets and annotation to document your road or highway design.

## How to Use Civil 3D 2019 for Site Design
 
Another common application of Civil 3D 2019 is site design. Civil 3D 2019 allows you to create detailed and realistic models of site development projects that can be easily modified and updated throughout the design process. You can also generate accurate plans, grading designs, earthwork calculations, stormwater management designs, and reports based on your model.
 
Some of the steps involved in site design using Civil 3D 2019 are:

- Create surfaces to represent the existing and proposed terrain conditions of your site.
- Create feature lines, parcels, alignments, profiles, grading objects, and pipe networks to define the layout and geometry of your site.
- Create corridors to generate a 3D model of your site based on the feature lines, parcels, alignments, profiles, grading objects, and pipe networks.
- Analyze your site model for slope analysis, volume calculations, cut and fill optimization, stormwater runoff analysis, etc.
- Create plan sheets and annotation to document your site design.

## How to Use Civil 3D 2019 for Rail Design
 
A third common application of Civil 3D 2019 is rail design. Civil 3D 2019 allows you to create dynamic and data-rich models of rail projects that can be easily modified and updated throughout the design process. You can also generate accurate plans, profiles, cross sections, quantities, reports based on your model.
