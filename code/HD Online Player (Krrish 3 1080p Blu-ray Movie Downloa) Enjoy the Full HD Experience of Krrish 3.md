Rohit discovers that the virus has no cure and can only be neutralized by his own blood. He decides to donate his blood to save the world, but Kaal learns about his plan and sends Kaya to impersonate Priya and kidnap him. Kaya succeeds in taking Rohit to Kaal's island, where Kaal reveals that he is Rohit's son, who was born with a defect due to Jadoo's DNA. He also reveals that he needs Rohit's bone marrow to cure his paralysis and become more powerful.
 
Krishna, who is unaware of Kaya's deception, falls in love with her thinking she is Priya. He also loses his powers due to the virus. However, he soon realizes the truth when he sees Priya's photo on a news channel. He confronts Kaya, who confesses her feelings for him and helps him escape from Kaal's island. She also restores his powers by injecting him with Rohit's blood.
 
Krishna returns to Mumbai and rescues Rohit from Kaal's clutches. He also reunites with Priya, who is pregnant with his child. However, Kaal follows them and attacks them with his army of Maanvars. He kills Kaya for betraying him and injures Rohit fatally. He also kidnaps Priya and tries to abort her child, who has inherited his father's powers.
 
Krishna fights against Kaal and his Maanvars in a climactic battle. He manages to save Priya and their child, but not before Kaal injects himself with Rohit's bone marrow and becomes a powerful monster. Kaal and Krishna engage in a fierce duel, where Kaal gains the upper hand. However, Rohit, who is still alive, uses his mind power to make the sun explode and create a shockwave that weakens Kaal. Krishna then uses his father's solar-powered gadget to absorb the sun's energy and kill Kaal with a powerful punch.
 
The film ends with Krishna holding his newborn son in his arms, while Rohit dies peacefully in Priya's arms. The baby smiles and shows a sign of having superpowers like his father.
