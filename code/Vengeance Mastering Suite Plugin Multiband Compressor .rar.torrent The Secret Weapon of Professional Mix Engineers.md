This plugin offers you the following features:
 
- You can choose between 1 band, 2, 3 or 4 band mode, depending on how much frequency-specific control you want.
- You can adjust the slope of the filters that divide the bands, from a very loose 6dB (resulting in lots of crossover from one to another) to a ruthlessly surgical 96dB (resulting in very isolated bands).
- You can use up to 4 independent compressors (one per selected band), with hard-/softknee mode, optional autogain, optional autorelease and graphical Ratio/Treshold curve display.
- You can use up to 4 limiters (one for each band) and 1 mastering limiter (sum), also with autorelease.
- You can use the New York Compression feature, which is a MIX knob that lets you blend some of the original dynamic back into the compressed signal.
- You can use the unique new feature called DPC (dynamic pattern compressor), which is a creative tool that lets you draw your own compression curves and apply them to any band.
- You can benefit from the high quality filter models, which do not introduce any phasing issues.
- You can monitor your input and output signals with live waveform scopes for every channel and a realtime FFT analyzer.
- You can access many cool presets that range from complete masterings to special effects.
