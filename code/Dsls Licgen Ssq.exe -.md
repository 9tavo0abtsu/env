## Step 1: Download and Install DSLS
 
Before you can use Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe, you need to have DSLS installed on your computer. DSLS is a software that manages the license keys for Dassault SystÃ¨mes products. You can download DSLS from the [Software License Keys](https://www.3ds.com/terms/software-keys/) page on the Dassault SystÃ¨mes website[^1^]. Follow the instructions on the page to install DSLS on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Identify the Computer ID or Target ID of Your Computer
 
After installing DSLS, you need to identify the computer ID or target ID of your computer. This is a unique identifier that is required to generate license keys for your computer. To identify your computer ID or target ID, you need to use the DSLS target ID Generator tool. You can download this tool from the same page where you downloaded DSLS[^1^]. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your computer and run this command:
 `DSLicTarget.exe ât` 
This will display your computer ID or target ID on the screen. Copy this value and save it somewhere.
 
## Step 3: Run Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe and Generate License Keys
 
Now you are ready to use Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe to generate license keys for your computer. You can download Dsls Licgen Ssq.exe from various sources on the internet, but be careful as some of them may contain viruses or malware. Make sure you scan the file with an antivirus program before running it.
