When you think of French-speaking countries, you might imagine the iconic landmarks of Paris, the scenic landscapes of Provence, or the snowy mountains of the Alps. But did you know that French is also spoken in places with very different climates and ecosystems? For example, in South America, there is a territory called \*\*French Guiana\*\* that is part of France and uses French as its official language. It is located on the northeastern coast of the continent and borders Brazil and Suriname. It has a tropical climate and is home to a rich biodiversity of plants and animals, including many endangered species. Some of the animals you can find in French Guiana are \*\*jaguars\*\*, \*\*sloths\*\*, \*\*caimans\*\*, \*\*toucans\*\*, and \*\*harpy eagles\*\*. French Guiana also has a large portion of the Amazon rainforest within its borders, making it an important site for conservation and research.
  
Another example of a French-speaking country with a diverse wildlife is \*\*Seychelles\*\*, an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean. It is located off the eastern coast of Africa and has a population of about 93,000 people. Seychelles has a tropical climate and is known for its beautiful beaches, coral reefs, and nature reserves. Some of the animals you can encounter in Seychelles are \*\*giant tortoises\*\*, \*\*fruit bats\*\*, \*\*black parrots\*\*, \*\*whale sharks\*\*, and \*\*sea turtles\*\*. Seychelles also has some unique species that are endemic to the islands, such as the \*\*Seychelles magpie-robin\*\*, the \*\*Seychelles warbler\*\*, and the \*\*Seychelles scops owl\*\*.
  
As you can see, French-speaking countries are not only found in Europe and North America, but also in other regions of the world where you can discover amazing natural wonders and diverse wildlife. If you are interested in learning more about these countries and their cultures, why not listen to our friend Florence who has traveled to some of them and has some stories to share? She will tell you about her adventures in la jungle (the jungle, pronounced: lah jahn-gl) and how she encountered some fascinating animals along the way.

One of the French-speaking countries that Florence visited recently was \*\*Seychelles\*\*, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean. She was amazed by the beauty and diversity of this tropical paradise, where she enjoyed swimming, snorkeling, hiking, and relaxing on the beach. She also learned a lot about the history and culture of Seychelles, which has been influenced by French, British, African, Indian, and Chinese settlers over the years.
  
Florence flew from Florence to Seychelles via Zurich and Dubai. The flight took about 16 hours in total, but she didn't mind because she was excited to see a new destination. She arrived at \*\*MahÃ© Island\*\*, the largest and most populated island in Seychelles, where she stayed at a cozy guesthouse near the capital city of \*\*Victoria\*\*. She spent a day exploring Victoria, where she visited the \*\*Seychelles National Botanical Gardens\*\*, the \*\*Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market\*\*, and the \*\*Seychelles National Museum\*\*. She also admired the colonial architecture and the colorful street art in the city center.
  
The next day, Florence took a ferry to \*\*Praslin Island\*\*, the second-largest island in Seychelles and home to some of the most stunning beaches in the world. She spent two days on Praslin, where she visited the \*\*VallÃ©e de Mai Nature Reserve\*\*, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that preserves a rare palm forest that contains the endemic \*\*coco de mer\*\*, a palm with the largest seed in the plant kingdom. She also enjoyed swimming and sunbathing at \*\*Anse Lazio\*\* and \*\*Anse Georgette\*\*, two of the most beautiful beaches on the island.
  
On her last day, Florence took another ferry to \*\*La Digue Island\*\*, the third-largest island in Seychelles and one of the most laid-back and charming places she had ever seen. She rented a bicycle and explored the island at her own pace, stopping at various attractions along the way. She visited the \*\*L'Union Estate\*\*, a former coconut plantation that now houses a museum, a vanilla farm, a tortoise pen, and a cemetery. She also saw the iconic \*\*Anse Source d'Argent\*\*, a beach with huge granite boulders and turquoise water that is often featured on postcards and magazines. She ended her day with a delicious Creole dinner at a local restaurant.
  
Florence had an unforgettable time in Seychelles, where she discovered a different side of French-speaking culture and nature. She was impressed by the hospitality and friendliness of the people, the diversity and richness of the wildlife, and the beauty and tranquility of the islands. She vowed to return someday and see more of this amazing country.
