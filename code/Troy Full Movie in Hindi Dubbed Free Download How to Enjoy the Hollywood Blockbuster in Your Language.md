Troy is not only a thrilling movie, but also a fascinating adaptation of ancient myths and legends. The film draws inspiration from Homer's Iliad, one of the oldest and most influential works of Western literature, as well as from other sources such as Quintus Smyrnaeus' Posthomerica, which narrates the events after the death of Hector. However, the film also makes some changes and additions to the original story, in order to create a more dramatic and appealing plot for modern audiences.
  
Some of the differences between the movie and the myth include:

- The movie portrays Achilles as a rebellious and charismatic hero who fights for his own glory, rather than for Agamemnon or the Greeks. In the Iliad, Achilles is more complex and conflicted, and his anger at Agamemnon is motivated by his sense of honor and justice.
- The movie depicts Hector as a noble and loyal prince who tries to avoid war and protect his family. In the Iliad, Hector is more aggressive and ambitious, and he kills Patroclus, Achilles' cousin and best friend, in a brutal fight.
- The movie shows Paris as a romantic and naive lover who elopes with Helen and causes the war. In the Iliad, Paris is more cowardly and selfish, and he abandons Helen when Menelaus challenges him to a duel.
- The movie features Briseis as a Trojan priestess who falls in love with Achilles and becomes his lover. In the Iliad, Briseis is a captive princess who is taken by Agamemnon from Achilles as a prize of war, and she has no romantic relationship with either of them.
- The movie omits many gods and goddesses who play important roles in the Iliad, such as Zeus, Athena, Apollo, Hera, Aphrodite, and Thetis. The only god who appears in the movie is Thetis' son Achilles.

Despite these differences, the movie still captures some of the main themes and messages of the Iliad, such as the tragedy of war, the power of fate, the glory of heroism, and the beauty of love. The movie also showcases some of the amazing facts and details about the ancient world of Troy and Greece, such as:

- The city of Troy was built in Malta at Fort Ricasoli from April to June 2003. Other important scenes were shot in MellieÄ§a, a small town in Malta, and on the island of Comino. [^1^]
- Brad Pitt trained for six months to get a body that looked like that of Greek statues. He also tore his left Achilles tendon during production. [^2^] [^3^]
- Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did not use stunt doubles for their epic duel. They made a gentlemen's agreement to pay for every accidental hit; $50 for each light blow and $100 for each hard blow. Pitt ended up paying Bana $750, and Bana didn't owe Pitt anything.
- The Trojan horse prop was given to the Turkish government as a gift. It is now on the boardwalk of Canakkale, a seaside city about an hour away from the site of the Troy ruins.
