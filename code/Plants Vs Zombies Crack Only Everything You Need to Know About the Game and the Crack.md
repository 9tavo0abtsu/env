The solution is to use a crack file that bypasses the game's protection and allows you to run it without a license key. A crack file is a modified version of the game's executable file that tricks the game into thinking that you have a valid copy. You can download a crack file from various websites that offer game cracks, such as MegaGames or Cracked-GamesPC.
 
To use a crack file, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download Plants Vs Zombies Game of the Year Edition from any source. You can use a torrent client or a direct download link.
2. Extract the game files to a folder on your computer.
3. Download a crack file for Plants Vs Zombies Game of the Year Edition from one of the websites mentioned above. Make sure you choose the right version of the crack that matches your game version.
4. Copy the crack file and paste it into the game folder, replacing the original executable file.
5. Run the game from the crack file and enjoy!

Note: Using a crack file may have some risks, such as viruses, malware, or legal issues. Use it at your own discretion and responsibility. We do not condone or endorse piracy in any way.
  
If you want to improve your skills and strategies in Plants Vs Zombies, you may want to check out some tips and tricks that can help you pass levels faster and get higher scores. Here are some of them:

- Maximize your Sunflower plant power. Sunflowers are essential for producing sun, which you need to plant more plants. Try to plant at least two rows of sunflowers in the back of your lawn, and protect them with Wall-nuts or other defensive plants.
- Use plant food on a plant to get an instant attack. Plant food is a special item that you can get from glowing zombies or by buying it with coins. You can use it on any plant to make it perform a powerful attack or ability. For example, using plant food on a Peashooter will make it shoot a barrage of peas, while using it on a Sunflower will make it produce extra sun.
- Kill the app to reshuffle the Purple World deck. In the Purple World levels, you have to use cards to plant plants instead of seed packets. The cards are randomly shuffled at the start of each level, and sometimes you may get unlucky and get cards that you don't need or want. To avoid this, you can kill the app and restart it before the level begins. This will reshuffle the cards and give you a new chance.
- Use Bonk Choy and Spikeweeds to survive Pirate World. In the Pirate World levels, you have to deal with zombies that can walk on planks over the water, or jump over your plants with parrots or cannons. To counter them, you can use Bonk Choy and Spikeweeds. Bonk Choy can punch zombies in front of or behind it, while Spikeweeds can damage zombies that walk over them or jump over your plants.
- Escape the level to prevent loss of a treasure yeti. The treasure yeti is a rare zombie that appears randomly in some levels. It drops a lot of coins when killed, but it also runs away quickly if it takes too much damage. If you want to keep the treasure yeti in the level and try again, you can escape the level by pausing the game and tapping on the menu button. This will not affect your progress or streaks.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that can help you play Plants Vs Zombies better. There are many more that you can discover by playing the game yourself or by checking out online guides and videos. Have fun and enjoy this awesome game!
