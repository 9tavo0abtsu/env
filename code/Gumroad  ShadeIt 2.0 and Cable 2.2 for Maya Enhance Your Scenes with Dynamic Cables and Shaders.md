If you are looking for a way to quickly create and edit realistic shaders and cables in Maya, you might want to check out these two scripts from Gumroad: ShadeIt 2.0 and Cable 2.2.
 
ShadeIt 2.0 is a script that will help you to easily create and edit realtime shaders for Maya viewport 2.0, without any UV need. You can achieve great results in just a few clicks, thanks to a shaders library that includes metal, plastic, glass, wood, fabric, and more. ShadeIt 2.0 works on Maya 2018 to Maya 2023 for Windows, MacOs and Linux, and requires at least Arnold Mtoa 3.2.

Both scripts are created by Wizix, a freelance 3D artist who specializes in hard surface modeling and texturing. You can find more of his work and tutorials on his [Gumroad page](https://wzx.gumroad.com/).

ShadeIt 2.0 and Cable 2.2 are not only useful for creating realistic shaders and cables, but also for adding details and complexity to your models. You can use them to create wires, pipes, hoses, chains, ropes, and more. You can also combine them with other scripts and tools to create even more variations and effects.
 
For example, you can use ShadeIt 2.0 to create a metal shader for your cable, and then use Cable 2.2 to add some twists and bends to it. You can also use Auto Clicker, another script from Wizix, to quickly duplicate and place your cable along a curve or a surface. You can then use Maya's built-in tools to adjust the position, rotation, and scale of your cable.
 
Another example is to use Cable 2.2 to create a rope with knots, and then use ShadeIt 2.0 to apply a fabric shader to it. You can also use Maya's nCloth system to simulate the dynamics of your rope and make it interact with other objects in your scene.
 
As you can see, ShadeIt 2.0 and Cable 2.2 are versatile and powerful scripts that can help you to create stunning shaders and cables in Maya. They are easy to use and affordable, and they come with support and tutorials from the creator. If you are interested in purchasing them or learning more about them, you can visit Wizix's [Gumroad page](https://wzx.gumroad.com/) and watch his demo videos.
