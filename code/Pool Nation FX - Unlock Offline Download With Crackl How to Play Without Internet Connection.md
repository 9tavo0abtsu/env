But that's not all. Playing pool and snooker also has many other benefits for your health and well-being. Here are some of them:
 
## Slows Down the Aging Process
 
Forget about expensive creams or pills that promise to slow down aging with no results for months. Snooker has been scientifically proven to directly affect the aging process in men[^1^]. According to a recent study from the University of Copenhagen, playing snooker can help older men stay active and healthy by alternating between active and passive phases during the game. This can help prevent muscle loss, improve blood circulation, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
 
## Sharpens the Mind
 
Playing pool and snooker requires a lot of mental skills, such as calculation, geometry, physics, and strategy. You have to estimate angles, distances, speeds, and spins, as well as plan your shots ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves. These mental exercises can help you improve your memory, logic, concentration, and problem-solving abilities[^2^]. They can also keep your brain young and prevent cognitive decline.
 
## Tones Muscles
 
Pool and snooker may not seem like very physical sports, but they actually involve a lot of stretching and bending that can tone your muscles. You have to reach for the cue ball, adjust your posture, balance on one foot, and swing your arm with precision. These movements can help you strengthen your back, hip, leg, arm, and shoulder muscles[^2^]. They can also improve your flexibility, agility, and coordination.
