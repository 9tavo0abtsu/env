## Method 1: Uninstall KB971033 Update
  
One of the possible reasons for this error is the KB971033 update, which is a Windows Activation Technologies update that checks whether your Windows is activated properly. If you have installed this update, you can try to uninstall it and see if the error goes away. Here are the steps:
  
1. Click the Start button and open Control Panel.
2. Go to System and Security and click Windows Update.
3. Click View installed updates on the left panel.
4. Find the KB971033 update from the list and right-click on it.

6. Restart your computer and check if the error is gone.

## Method 2: Use SLMGR -REARM Command
  
Another way to fix this error is to use the SLMGR -REARM command, which resets the licensing status of your Windows and allows you to re-activate it. This command can be used up to three times, so you can try it if you have not used it before. Here are the steps:

1. Click the Start button and type cmd in the search box.
2. Right-click on cmd.exe and select Run as administrator.

6. Enter your product key and follow the instructions to activate your Windows.

## Method 3: Turn off Windows Automatic Update
  
If you don't want to uninstall any updates or use any commands, you can also try to turn off Windows automatic update, which may prevent your Windows from detecting any activation issues. However, this method is not recommended as it may expose your computer to security risks and performance issues. If you want to try it anyway, here are the steps:

1. Click the Start button and open Control Panel.
2. Go to System and Security and click Windows Update.
3. Click Change settings on the left panel.
