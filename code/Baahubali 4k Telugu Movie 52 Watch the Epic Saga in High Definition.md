The film is divided into two parts: The Beginning and The Conclusion. The Beginning introduces the main characters and sets up the conflict between Baahubali and Bhallaladeva. The film begins with Sivagami saving an infant from drowning and raising him as her own son. The infant grows up to be Sivudu (Prabhas), a free-spirited young man who falls in love with Avanthika, a member of a rebel group that wants to rescue Devasena, the former princess of Kuntala, from the clutches of Bhallaladeva. Sivudu learns that he is actually Baahubali, the son of Amarendra Baahubali, the former king of Mahishmati who was killed by Kattappa. The film ends with a cliffhanger as Kattappa reveals that he killed Baahubali on the orders of Sivagami.
 
The Conclusion resumes the story from where The Beginning left off. The film reveals the backstory of Baahubali and Bhallaladeva, and how they became rivals for the throne. The film shows how Baahubali met and married Devasena, and how Bhallaladeva plotted against them with the help of his father Bijjaladeva and Kattappa. The film also shows how Sivagami changed her mind and ordered Kattappa to kill Baahubali after being manipulated by Bhallaladeva. The film culminates in an epic battle between Baahubali and Bhallaladeva, where Baahubali avenges his father's death and reclaims his rightful place as the king of Mahishmati.
